• the Greater North Sea, including the Kattegat and stretches of water such as Fair Isle, Cromarty, Forth, Forties, Dover, Wight, and Portland
• the English Channel and Celtic Seas
• Western and Central Mediterranean Sea and Ionian Sea
• Bay of Biscay, Iberian coast and North-East Atlantic
• Adriatic Sea
• Aegean - Levantine Sea (Eastern Mediterranean)
• Azores - Madeira EEZ
• Canary Islands
• Baltic Sea
• Black Sea
• Norwegian – Icelandic seas

The DTM is based upon more than 7700 bathymetric survey data sets and Composite DTMs that have been gathered from 27 data providers from 18 European countries and involving 169 data originators. The gathered survey data sets can be discovered and requested for access through the Common Data Index (CDI) data discovery and access service that also contains additional European survey data sets for global waters. The Composite DTMs can be discovered through the Sextant Catalogue service. Both discovery services make use of SeaDataNet standards and services and have been integrated in the EMODnet portal (https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/bathymetry#bathymetry-services ). 

In addition, the EMODnet Map Viewer (https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/geoviewer/ ) gives users wide functionality for viewing and downloading the EMODnet digital bathymetry such as:
• water depth (refering to the Lowest Astronomical Tide Datum - LAT) in gridded form 
on a DTM grid of 1/8 * 1/8 arc minute of longitude and latitude (ca 230 * 230 meters)
• option to view depth parameters of individual DTM cells and references to source data
• option to download DTM in 16 tiles in different formats: EMO, EMO (without GEBCO data), ESRI ASCII, ESRI ASCII Mean Sea Level, XYZ, NetCDF (CF), RGB GeoTiff and SD
• layer with a number of high resolution DTMs for coastal regions
• layer with wrecks from the UKHO Wrecks database.
The NetCDF (CF) DTM files are fit for use in a special 3D Viewer software package which is based on the existing open source NASA World Wind JSK application. It has been developed in the frame of the EU FP7 Geo-Seas project (another sibling of SeaDataNet for marine geological and geophysical data) and is freely available. The 3D viewer also supports the ingestion of WMS overlay maps. The SD files can also be used for 3D viewing by means of the freely available iView4De(Fledermaus) software.

The original datasets themselves are not distributed but described in the metadata services, giving clear information about the background survey data used for the DTM, their access restrictions, originators and distributors and facilitating requests by users to originator."
